# Health Care Plus System

## Project Overview

A Health Care PLus System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate hospital operations. It encompasses patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, electronic health records (EHR), inventory management, and reporting, enhancing overall healthcare efficiency and patient care.

### Project Details

- **Project Owner:** Muhammad Tahir
- **Developer:** Usman Asghar
- **Course Name:** Software Engineering
- **Technology Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

## Features

### 1. Patient Management

Efficiently manage patient information, including personal details, medical history, treatment plans, and communication logs. Enable healthcare providers to deliver personalized care by having comprehensive patient profiles at their fingertips.

### 2. Appointment Scheduling

Facilitate seamless scheduling of appointments through an intuitive interface. The system should consider various factors such as doctor availability, patient preferences, and urgency, ensuring a well-organized and optimized flow of healthcare services.

### 3. Billing System

Automate the billing process to eliminate errors and improve transparency. Generate detailed invoices, handle insurance claims, and provide patients with a clear breakdown of charges, thus fostering trust and accountability in financial transactions.

### 4. Electronic Health Records (EHR)

Digitize health records, ensuring secure and easily accessible information for authorized personnel. Implement features such as real-time updates, document attachments, and user-friendly interfaces to streamline the creation, management, and retrieval of electronic health records.

### 5. Inventory Management

Optimize hospital resource utilization by implementing a robust inventory management system. Keep track of medical supplies, equipment, and pharmaceuticals, ensuring timely replenishment and preventing shortages that could impact patient care.

### 6. Reporting

Enable healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions by providing comprehensive reporting functionalities. Generate reports on patient outcomes, resource utilization, and financial performance to support strategic planning and continuous improvement.

## Technology Stack

The project harnesses the power of the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB:** A flexible NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for building robust and scalable backend systems.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A server-side JavaScript runtime for executing server-side logic.


## Getting Started
To run the Hwalth Care Plus System locally, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB: [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TahirRajpoot/HealthCarePlus_SE_Project.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install --force
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the following variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY = 
GMAIL_USER = 
GMAIL_PASS =
CLIENT_SECRET = 
CLIENT_ID =
```
Re[;ace thes with your gmailid, clientid, gmail password, secret key, client secret

### 4. Run the Application

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend server will run on http://localhost:8080 by default.

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend development server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

### 5. Open in Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the MERN stack application.

## Additional Information

- The backend API routes are available at http://localhost:8080/api/.
- Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the backend server.
- You can customize the application by modifying the code in the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
